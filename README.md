# Countries Info Website

This project is a simple and interactive website that displays detailed information about various countries using a public API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to easily access data like country names, capitals, populations, currencies, languages, and more. It's a great example of how to integrate APIs into a responsive web design.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and expand the features!
